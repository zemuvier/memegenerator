Let's generate your own memes using this memegenerator!

Now I'm working on version 2.0 for this project. What I plan to use:

#. Python
#. Travis CI
#. Docker
#. OpenCV

I am still researching for the best Python library to communicate with users
(Django, Web2Py, Flask etc) and also I'm thinking to use JS to create UI part
of this app.

Maybe I will add some CLI interface for creating memes from everywhere.

Also 1 one technology I want to add is to deploy this app using Docker and
Heroku.
